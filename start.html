<p>Welcome to part 1 of day 1</p>
<p>import math
  def a(v): return math.sqrt(v*int(input()))</p>
<p>Type this into your python terminal then add a(10 or any other intger) enter, and input a number.</p>
<p>Input is a string(str in python used like this str(convert non string into a string) the int(intger) changes the string to an int.</p>
<p>v is a intger given for a value you can replace like in math a*5 a=2 2*5=10.</p>
<p>Creating a function it can be like this def v(x):
<p>y=x+1# local varible can't be used outside the function,</p>
<p>return y, or like this def v(x): return x+1</p>
<p>You can multipy and use, some of the symbols on your keyboard to do math like it is.</p>
<p>And import functions with import like math which is a premade function you can use to code fast, math.sqrt.</p>
<p>For the last of day one return can be used to to takt the function output in the function to be used in varibles, and the print function.</p>
<p>In day 2 you'll be able to learn how to print and more.</p>
